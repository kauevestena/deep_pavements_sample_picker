Set the desired prompts at "configs/prompted_classes.csv", following the available model.
Set the desired territories at "configs/territories.csv", following the available model, territories must be geocodable in Nomitatim API, in case of more than one results, the one with biggest "relevance" will be chosen.  

In both cases watch for csv consistency (i recommend using CSVLint and RAinbowCSV).
