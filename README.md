# Deep Pavements Sample Picker
Deep Pavements is a project to train a Convolutional Neural Network to do semantic segmentation.
This is the part where the samples got collected, to then be labeled. It leverages the capacities of the great [Language Segment-Anything
](https://github.com/luca-medeiros/lang-segment-anything) that's capable of predicting themes not present on training.

# Please refer to SETUP.md to start

A frozen version of the working requirements was made at "frozen_requirements.txt", in case of image building failure with latest packages getting updated
